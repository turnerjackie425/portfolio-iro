I started playing around with Ruby a little over a year ago. I fell in love immediately. Since then I have completed a couple of free online courses and also completed the Rails Web Development course through Bloc.io. I live in a very small town that does not offer employment in this field, so I am searching for a remote, full-time, entry-level position.
