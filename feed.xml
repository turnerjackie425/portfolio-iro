        <title>My experience at Bloc</title>
        <link>http://example.com/2015/12/11/my-experience-at-bloc.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://example.com/2015/12/11/my-experience-at-bloc.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been playing around with Ruby for a few months via free coding websites and wanted to take some sort of lessons to really understand the language. An online course was best for me since I live in a very small town with very few opportunities. Also, I needed to be home with my two young children during my course. I found Bloc and it sounded perfect! What REALLY sold me on bloc.io was having my very own mentor and the promise of help with a portfolio as well as job prep. I couldn’t wait to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring out how I was going to pay for my course, I immediately enrolled in the Rails Web Development course. I had to wait about 12 days to start and I could not wait!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was waiting, I did some free courses online in preparation. I had completed a couple previous to this so it really wasn’t too difficult. Then the day finally came!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mentor was a young software engineer from San Diego. I really admired her work ethic and we got along really well. I was really excited to be able to work her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My course started off with some Ruby basics, which was pretty simple since I had been doing some Ruby stuff on my own. My mentor was really helpful and I was enjoying myself a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I hit the point in the course where territory was unfamiliar. Here was the challenge I knew was coming! I had a ton of questions form mentor, but she seemed to be too busy to answer. I scoured the internet and the found answers on my own, mostly through stackoverflow.com. Bloc also has a Slack channel and a Facebook page called Bloc Hackers Club. I found both of these resources very helpful as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month into my course, my mentor was canceling or rescheduling appointments often and was very difficult to get ahold of. This was an expensive course! I chose Bloc because of the opportunity to have a mentor. I felt I wasn’t getting the full attention I needed. I realized that my mentor had a full-time career and that was her main priority. But I also realized that I needed someone with more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I sent my mentor an email explaining my feelings and sent in my request for a new mentor. My new mentor seemed knowledgeable and excited to work with me and I was really excited to work with him as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time my new mentor was involved, I was wrapping up the theory part of the course and moving on to actually building an application called Bloccit, a Reddit replica. I was so excited to put my new found knowledge to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course once I started the application, I had a ton of questions. So naturally, I turned to my new mentor. He was very helpful and knowledgeable, as expected. As time went on, it seemed I was running into the same problems I had with my first mentor. Unanswered questions galore. But this time was worse! He would actually completely blow off our meetings and rarely answer my questions via Skype. What had I done? I was better off with my first mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to waste anymore time searching for mentors. I needed to concentrate on my course. So that is exactly what I did. My new mentor would occasionally answer my questions and occasionally make our scheduled meetings, but I knew I couldn’t count on that. I took what I could get from him and continued to found the vast majority of my answers online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time with my new mentor became scarce and then nonexistent. I ended up flying completely solo for my capstone project, portfolio and job prep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot with my coursework through Bloc. A lot of Ruby, some HTML, CSS and even a little Javascript! The biggest lesson I learned though was how to figure it out on my own. I am actually thankful for the lack of help from my second mentor. Now I can say I did it by myself. And I am very proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a post which includes a feature image specified in the front matter of the post. The feature image spans the full-width of the page, and is shown with the title on permalink pages.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Markdown and HTML</title>
        <link>http://example.com/2014/11/28/markdown-and-html.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://example.com/2014/11/28/markdown-and-html.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeykll supports the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tables have also been extended from Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;First Header&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Second Header&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sample_feature_img_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Geometric pattern with fading gradient&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Pygments by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// count to ten&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// count to twenty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}&lt;/script&gt; can be displayed inline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2}&lt;/script&gt;
