<p class="center"><img src="/assets/scraphappy_index_page_img.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I spent most of my bloc.io course wondering what I would do for a capstone project. The thought of it was almost overwhelming. Then I realized that I should do something that shows what am I most passionate about. And that, of course, is my family. A digital scrapbook with a Pinterest type layout is the result of that thought.</p>

<p>My mentor with Bloc was scarcely available for guidance, so I flew solo on this project and it took me a lot longer than I had anticipated. I went back and forth on what sort of pages this application should have. Should a user be able to have multiple scrapbooks with multiple pages? What about adding a collaboration feature where other users can add to a scrapbook, with permission from the scrapbooks owner, of course. These ideas were great but I needed a good backbone first. I quickly learned that I was making it too complicated. I needed to simplify this application. It is now a simple one page scrapbook. A user can sign-up with an email verification through send grid and upload photos using the paperclip gem. I added a like feature as well in preparation for the user collaboration that will follow eventually.</p>

<p>Production went much smoother and faster after simplifying the problem. Until I went to add the masonry gem. It wasn’t working. The layout was horrible! Being a ‘Ruby Newbie’ meant I would have to find a way to make this work via the internet. I followed the instructions on the masonry gem documentation, but was still having problems. The layout wasn’t working anything like I had expected. So, I scoured the internet for a solution. Stack overflow didn’t have the answer (which was really surprising to me. I have found many answers on that site). YouTube was my saving grace. I watched a tutorial and VIOLA! It was finally working.</p>

<p>Working masonry gem/Scraphappy index page:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/scraphappy-edit-page.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Out of all the projects I have done so far, I learned the most from this one. I even went back and made some adjustments on my older projects with my new found  knowledge!</p>

<p>The app is still in ‘simple form’ (Ruby pun intended!). This is version one of this application. I will keep working on it for continued learning and experience!</p>
